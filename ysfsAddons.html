				The Central Mediterranean Islands (fictional) map is where I really began to get a better sense of map-making.
				I started experimenting more with ground objects, colours, the tools in the Scenery Editor and other
				elements to create some unique elevation grid buildings (like the 1,800 ft tall CMI Center in Mandiola and the
				"Sails at Linbury"). I also added a third fictional island named "Ocaso" which is Spanish for "sunset", and
				used more of the new techniques I had acquired in sprucing up Turbot and Winnsworth Islands. I also researched
				quite a bit on airport markings, placement of the Instrument Landing System (ILS) box in relation to the
				Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) lights, and more.
			</p>
			<p>
				Soon after releasing CMI, Patrick31337 approached me about incorporating two of his own real-world
				islands he had made into the CMI map - Malta and Pantelleria. I was quite honoured to do that as he is well-known for
				his own <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/yspmnv/pmnv-maps" target="_blank">work</a>, and he also gave me permission to modify
				those islands as necessary. I got to work on these islands, and with their inclusion, CMI <i>Extended</i> became the
				latest addition in the long line of modifications to the original Turbot Island map. I hope you enjoy flying around
				CMI and CMI-E as much as I have enjoyed making them.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can download either CMI or CMI-E, but since the latter contains all of CMI plus the new additions, Malta and Pantelleria,
				I have decided most people will prefer downloading the extended version. Either way, both versions are available below for your
				convenience.

					10 of the 25 repaints in my Super King Air Repaint Pack. I've repainted these
					based on colour combinations I thought would go well on the King Air 200.
					Sometimes it was as simple as something on a t-shirt, or sometimes I saw
					a candy wrapper, and sometimes I saw a real-world airline colour scheme and
					applied that colour scheme to the Super King Air as best as I could.

				A collection of 25 repaints of the Super King Air 200. No much to say here
				except hope you like them! Made possible by the inclusion of a .dnm (dynamic
				model) file by its original creator, Taskforce58 of YSFHQ. It is a
				colouring base file which you can edit, using the "find-and-replace" feature of
				any text editor to repaint all 13 different areas on the aircraft (otherwise
				my repainting skills are basically non-existent).

				TF-SKARP 2 contains 10 repaints. All of these were colour

				member Taskforce58 for the aircraft and the coloringbase.dnm file, which made
				these repaints possible.
